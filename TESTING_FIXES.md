# Test Isolation and localStorage Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **localStorage Access in SSR/Test Environments**
**Problem**: Theme provider was accessing localStorage during initialization, causing issues in test environments.

**Solution**: Added safe localStorage access with try-catch blocks and SSR checks:
```typescript
const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(() => {
  // Safe localStorage access for SSR and testing environments
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return defaultTheme
  try {
    return (localStorage.getItem(storageKey) as Theme) || defaultTheme
  } catch {
    return defaultTheme
  }
})
```

### 2. **Test Isolation Issues**
**Problem**: Multiple test components were being rendered in the same DOM, causing "Found multiple elements" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper cleanup in global test setup
- Used individual containers for each test
- Implemented `cleanup()` from testing library

### 3. **Global Test Setup**
**Created**: `tests/setup.ts` with:
- Global localStorage mocking
- matchMedia mocking for system theme detection
- Proper cleanup between tests
- Document class cleanup

### 4. **Improved Test Structure**
**Changes**:
- Each test uses its own container for better isolation
- Proper beforeEach/afterEach cleanup
- Consistent mocking across all tests
- Better error handling for edge cases

## Key Fixes Applied

### Theme Provider (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`)
- Safe localStorage access with SSR checks
- Try-catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Graceful fallback to default theme

### Test Setup (`tests/setup.ts`)
- Global localStorage and matchMedia mocks
- Automatic cleanup between tests
- Consistent test environment

### Test Files
- Individual containers for test isolation
- Proper use of render utilities
- Consistent mock usage
- Better error boundary testing

### Vite Configuration
- Added test configuration with proper setup files
- Enabled jsdom environment
- CSS processing for tests

## Results
- ✅ All 19 tests passing
- ✅ No more "Found multiple elements" errors
- ✅ Proper localStorage isolation between tests
- ✅ System theme detection working correctly
- ✅ CI/CD ready test suite

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in its own container
2. **Mock Consistency**: Global mocks with proper cleanup
3. **Safe API Access**: Defensive programming for browser APIs
4. **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling in tests
5. **CI/CD Compatibility**: Tests work reliably in automated environments
