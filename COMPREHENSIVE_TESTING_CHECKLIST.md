## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Backend Won't Start:**

**Problem:** Port 3001 already in use

```powershell
# Find process using port 3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Restart backend
npm run dev:backend
````

**Problem:** Module not found errors

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Try again
npm run dev:backend
```

### **Frontend Won't Start:**

**Problem:** Port 5173 already in use

```powershell
# Find process using port 5173
netstat -ano | findstr :5173

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Restart frontend
npm run dev
```

**Problem:** Build errors

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
npm run clean
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Tests Failing:**

**Problem:** "Network error" or "Request timeout"

- Check backend is running: http://localhost:3001/health
- Restart backend if needed
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Problem:** "Cannot read property" errors

- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart both servers

**Problem:** Validation not working

- Check browser console for errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify backend terminal shows no errors
- Try a simple YAML first: `name: test`

### **Performance Issues:**

**Problem:** Validation very slow (> 5 seconds)

- Check backend terminal for errors
- Check if antivirus is scanning files
- Try smaller YAML content first
- Check system resources (CPU/Memory)

**Problem:** Browser freezing

- Close other browser tabs
- Restart browser
- Check for memory leaks in console

### **Quick Reset:**

**If everything is broken:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Terminal 2: Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)

# Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Clear everything (if npm run clean exists)
npm run clean

# Reinstall
npm install

# Start fresh
# Terminal 1:
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2:
npm run dev
```
