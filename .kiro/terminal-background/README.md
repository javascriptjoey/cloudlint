# Kiro Terminal Background

This folder contains the background image for the Kiro-themed terminal.

## Background Image Setup

The background image is configured to be:

- Very subtle (low opacity ~5-10%)
- Centered in the terminal
- Non-distracting to text readability
- Kiro ghost themed

## Manual Setup Instructions

Since we can't directly create image files, you'll need to:

1. Create or download a Kiro ghost logo image
2. Save it to: `C:\Users\YourUsername\.kiro\terminal-background\kiro-ghost.png`
3. The Windows Terminal settings will automatically use it

## Recommended Image Specifications

- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Size:** 800x800 pixels (or similar square)
- **Style:** Simple ghost silhouette or Kiro logo
- **Color:** Light gray or white (will be made transparent by settings)

## Alternative: Use ASCII Art

If you don't have an image, the terminal will still look great with just the colorful prompt!
